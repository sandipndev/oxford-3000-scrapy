# Oxford 3000 Dictionary Web Scraper

The file `classword.py` uses BeautifulSoup to Web Scrape the Oxford 3000 Dictionary.

Currently, it's integrated with discord so that when `a/mean wordname` is sent, the meaning is searched for and sent.

Sample example (note the things scraped for):

**Searching for the meaning of Love:**

`a/mean love`
